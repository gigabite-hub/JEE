              <p style="margin-top:40px;"><strong style="color:#CA3817;text-decoration:none;font-size:28px;">1. Initial Cost Per Lead</strong></p>

			  <p>According to <a href="https://research.hubspot.com/charts/cost-per-lead-benchmarks-by-industry" target="_blank">HubSpot</a>, the average (initial) cost per lead is between <span style="color:#006600;"><strong>$11 to $100+ USD</strong></span> with a very low closing ratio.</p>

              <p class="text-center"> <img src="https://jee.jibbio.com//images/average-cost-per-lead-benchmarks-by-industry.gif" class="img-responsive center-block" /></p>

			  <p style="margin-top:40px;"><strong style="color:#CA3817;text-decoration:none;font-size:28px;">2. Don't Be Fooled</strong></p>

              <p>However, there are many "unknown variables" associated with purchased leads, which ultimately increases the average (true) cost per lead such as the following:</p>

			  
              <p class=" lazy-fade-l" style="font-size:20px;color:#313131;"><strong>A) Are leads from genuine people that actually inquired or are they "promotion leads?" (e.g. "Enter to win a free car!") </strong></p>

              <p class=" lazy-fade-l" style="font-size:20px;color:#313131;"><strong>B) How many other competing businesses were shared (sold) the same leads?</strong></p>

              <p class=" lazy-fade-l" style="font-size:20px;color:#313131;"><strong>C) Lead source? (organic search, email marketing, website, social media, affiliates, etc.)</strong></p>

              <p>(B) and (C) above are significant factors that lower the lead quality (e.g. if the lead was shared (sold) to at least <span style="color:#ff0010;">4</span> other local competing businesses, and/or if the leads were acquired by "affiliates," which means those affiliates likely shared (sold) the same leads that youâ€™ve purchased to other lead generation companies as well).</p>

              <p class="text-center"> <img src="https://jee.jibbio.com//images/purchased-leads-shared-with-business-competitors.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" /></p>

              <p>Many 3rd party lead service providers may NOT disclose the above for obvious reasons.  And even if they did, you could NEVER know the truth whether the lead is indeed exclusive, shared, and/or the source.</p>

              <p>In addition, some lead generation providers will unethically "spin leads" (conceptually similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_spinning" target="_blank">article spinning</a>), meaning that they will use automated programs to revise the content, lead source, then resend (charge you) for the duplicate lead(s) at a future date. </p>

              <p>These are known problems associated within the leads buying industry.</p>



			  <p style="margin-top:40px;"><strong style="color:#CA3817;text-decoration:none;font-size:28px;">3. True Cost Per Lead</strong></p>

			  <p>  Taking the above factors into consideration, that likely explains why the average (true) cost per lead is higher at <span style="color:#006600;"><strong>$198 USD</strong></span>.</p>

              <p style="font-size:26px;color:#313131;margin-top:40px;"><strong>Example</strong></p>

              <p>Let's say that you paid only <span style="color:#006600;"><strong>$20 USD</strong></span> per lead and that the same lead was shared (sold) with <span style="color:#ff0010;">4</span> other competitors:<br/>

              <p class="text-center"> <img src="https://jee.jibbio.com//images/buy-leads-shared-with-competitors.png" class="img-responsive center-block" /></p>

			  <span style="color:#ff0010;">Cost per lead</span>: $20 USD<br/>
			  <span style="color:#ff0010;">Businesses sharing lead</span>: 5 (you + competitors)<br/>
			  <span style="color:#ff0010;">Maximum lead-to-sale closing percentage</span>: 20% (100% / businesses sharing lead)<br/><br/>

			  <span style="color:#ff0010;"><i>Actual cost per <u>exclusive</u> lead</span>: <span style="color:#006600;"><strong>$100 USD</strong></span> (businesses sharing lead X cost per lead)</i>
			  </p>

			  <p>NOTE: The actual cost per exclusive lead is based on a 100% closing rate (not realistic)- lower the closing rate, higher the lead cost.</p>
