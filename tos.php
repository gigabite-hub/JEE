<!--
<p id="textmessaging"> 5. <strong> SMS Sending Policy</strong></p>
<p> Compliance may seem like a hassle, but it is absolutely mandatory.  Otherwise, you risk legal repercussions for non-compliance.  For example, in 2012 “Papa John’s” in the USA agreed to pay over $16 million to settle a class action lawsuit brought against them for failure to get proper user consent.</p>
<p> To avoid legal consequences, Jibbio.com strongly advises its members to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), which provides some basic consumer protection when it comes to SMS (text) marketing. </p>
<p> "<i>However you decide to get consent, you should have a clear call to action associated with your opt-in mechanism.</i>"</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Express Written Consent</strong></p>
<p> According to the TCPA, customers must give businesses “express written consent” before the business sends them text messages. This written consent cannot be buried in a lengthy consent form full of legalese. Consent must be clear and conspicuous, so the recipient knows what they’re signing up for. </p>
<p> Even text messages that are merely informational require consent. Here are the different ways you can get customer consent and act as an opt-in to receive text messages from you:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Send a keyword to a shortcode</li>
  <li>Enter a phone number on a web form online</li>
  <li>Sign up at a physical location</li>
</ul>
It’s important to note that you are not allowed to require a user to opt-in to your text program as a condition to purchase property, goods or services.
</p>
<p> You should have a clear call to action associated with your opt-in mechanism to obtain consent from the user. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Call to Action SMS Marketing</strong></p>
<p> A call to action is the message that prompts the individual to opt in to your SMS campaign. It should consist of the following: </p>
<p> A) <strong>SMS Campaign Purpose</strong><br>
  Let your subscribers know what they’re signing up for. Are they getting reminders? Coupons? Tips? Specify what you’re offering so that there are no surprises. </p>
<p> B) <strong>Message Frequency</strong><br>
  Include the approximate number of messages the customer should expect to receive in a given week or month. This will prevent any unexpected or intrusive texts. </p>
<p> C) <strong>Message and Data Rates</strong><br>
  Even though unlimited texting is has become more common, some users may have to pay a small fee to receive text messages, so you have to inform your subscribers that these charges may be incurred if they sign up to your program. </p>
<p> D) <strong>Terms and Conditions</strong><br>
  List all the Terms and Conditions in full beneath the CTA or provide a link nearby. This list should contain:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The Identity of company/brand/program</li>
  <li>Customer care contact information</li>
  <li>Description of the product for which people are signing up to</li>
  <li>Opt-out instructions in bold type (e.g. SMS “STOP” to [phone number] to unsubscribe) </li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p> List the Privacy Policy in full beneath the CTA or provide a link nearby. </p>
<p> All this information may seem overwhelming, but it’s actually quite simple. </p>
<p> <strong>Confirmation</strong></p>
<p> Regardless of how they signed up, your very first text to any user must be a compliance message confirming opt-in. It should reiterate some important information, including: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Your identity</li>
  <li>Message Frequency</li>
  <li>That message and data rates may apply</li>
  <li>How to opt-out</li>
</ul>
